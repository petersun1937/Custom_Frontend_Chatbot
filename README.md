## Features

1. **Chat UI**
   - A user-friendly interface to interact with the chatbot, allowing users to send messages to and receive responses from the backend server.

2. **Document Upload**
   - Users can upload documents to provide additional context for the chatbot, improving the relevance of the responses.

3. **Dark Mode/Light Mode**
   - The app includes a toggle for switching between dark mode and light mode, allowing users to choose the theme that suits their preference.
